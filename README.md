# Nextbook
Nextbook serves a dual function as a price comparison platform for textbook prices throughout the web, as well as a platform for William & Mary students to discuss information about class textbooks. 

Scanning throughout the web, the application will search for the cheapest prices for students who are living life on a budget.
Furthermore, it will allow students to provide information on the utilization of the textbook on the website, whether that be if it is used for readings, homework questions, or if it is not needed at all! Moreover, it will allow users to comment on either the class or the textbook to inform future students. 

In this way, the usability is catered to the individual student. Providing information on textbooks, as well as the classes the students
are taking to a certain extent, Nextbook is the all-in-one destination for finding the best offers and value for your textbooks.

This will be built with the Django web framework, which utilizes the Python programming language. As it is lightweight, we will also use SQLite as the database.
